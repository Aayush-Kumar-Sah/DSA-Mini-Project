 Super-XO  
<br>
Just like in regular tic-tac-toe, the two players (X and O) take turns, starting with X. The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots. Next the opponent plays, however they are forced to play in the small board indicated by the relative location of the previous move. For example, if X plays in the top right square of a small (3 × 3) board, then O has to play in the small board located at the top right of the larger board. Playing any of the available spots decides in which small board the next player plays.
If a move is played so that it is to win a small board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe , then the entire small board is marked as won by the player in the larger board. Once a small board is won by a player or it is filled completely, no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play in any other board. Game play ends when either a player wins the larger board or there are no legal moves remaining, in which case the game is a draw.

What is this project about?
<br>
The Super XO Game is a dynamic and engaging implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe, which is developed using 2D array concept of Data Structures and Algorithm. Even though we are doing this for marks and our future, but still it was so fun and enjoyable doing this.
<br>
1.	Talking about the feature of the game : 
•	The game features a standard 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid where two players take turns.
•	Players can choose to play as either 'X' or 'O' and compete to form a winning sequence.
•	The game ends when a player wins or when the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
<br>
2.	Data structure used in creating this :
<br>
•	A 2D array, or two-dimensional array, is a fundamental data structure that organizes data in a grid-like fashion. Unlike a 1D array, which is a linear collection of elements, a 2D array allows data to be stored in rows and columns, creating a structured matrix.
<br>
In the context of the "Super XO Game" project, a 2D array is employed to efficiently store and manage the game board, providing a systematic approach to tracking the game state and enabling easy access and manipulation of individual cells.
<br>
Super XO Game is a well-structured, educational, and fun DSA mini project that not only demonstrates strong coding and algorithmic skills but also provides an enjoyable experience for players. It showcases the practical application of data structures and algorithms in real-world scenarios, making it an excellent addition to the university's computer science program.
